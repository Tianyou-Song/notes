# notes

look at resume:
1st: tech stack
c#, c++, java
volunteer experience
good description of projects
no generic tech stack
customer facing experience for customer facing roles

pitfall: can't tell what you are
objective: what do you do

developer: blurb and projects more than resume
finish project




cover letters:
no
yes: explain how you can pring value to company, know what company is doing, why passionate about industry, personal connection to industry
yes: you paid attention, have some passion
no: only if first sentence catch eye, answer questions
not necessarily traditional, THANK YOU LETTER IMPORTANT, express not taking chance
a couple of personal sentences


what do you look for apart form technical skills
can you learn? take ownership of large parjects
can't be stagnant, unwilling to learn
don't seize up, be flexible

think of different cases, ask different questions
"let's take 5 minutes to talk about the structure of the problem"
express meaning of code to interviewer

clarify the challenge, make sure you know the question
SOUND EXCITED


phone screen:
SOUND EXCITED
don't bypass recruiter
no "we", what 'you' did
no digging questions
how you're going to stay there

fascinated by challenges
enjoy things obstructing your path
create self identity
know who you're speaking with

culture and fit important
can grow with branding
think of projects with ROI perspectivee, frame in business minded way, what the value of it would be

contract easier, no commitment
contract always give number, no culture and fit

always positive
"look forward to your call, i'm really excited about the opportunity"


q&a:
ask 'what are the next steps'

what are you thinking about when making decision?
    general demeanor, tone

ask questions
"interview the interviewer"
understand self identity of company
'is original founders still there'
founders stories
ask questions about business model
what role do developers play
contract: not important, stay with project

easy way to make 'human connection'?
reflect on self identity, know company mission, what I do to align with company mission
show what's your passions, how do i want impact on the company

biggest challenge you face?
false reads, find people who write solid, clean code

going up against big company salary level

google...etc gobble up all the talent

all onsight people agree right fit
